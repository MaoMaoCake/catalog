## About Kyverno Policy Reporter

Kyverno Policy Reporter is a monitoring and observability tool that provides visibility into Kubernetes policy engine
results. It collects and processes PolicyReport and ClusterPolicyReport resources generated by policy engines like
Kyverno, Falco, or Trivy, and makes this data available through multiple channels for monitoring, alerting, and
analysis.

Policy Reporter can export metrics to Prometheus for tracking compliance trends over time, send notifications to various
targets including Slack, Discord, Loki, and Elasticsearch when policy violations occur, and provide an optional web
interface for browsing and analyzing policy reports. It supports multi-tenancy with namespace-scoped reporting and can
aggregate policy reports from multiple clusters, making it an essential tool for maintaining visibility into your
cluster's security and compliance posture.
