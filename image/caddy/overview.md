## About Caddy

Caddy is an extensible, open source web server platform that uses TLS by default. It's designed to make HTTPS easy and
automatic, with powerful configuration options and a modular architecture.

Caddy is most often used as an HTTPS server, reverse proxy, and static file server. It's the first web server to use
HTTPS automatically and by default without any configuration required. Caddy is written in Go, providing higher memory
safety guarantees than traditional web servers written in C.

Key features include:

- Automatic HTTPS with Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL
- HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, and HTTP/3 support out of the box
- Easy configuration with the Caddyfile or native JSON config
- Dynamic configuration via REST API
- Extensible modular architecture
- Production-ready, having served trillions of requests
