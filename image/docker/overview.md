## About Docker CLI

The Docker CLI is the official command-line interface for Docker. It provides a comprehensive set of commands to build,
run, and manage Docker containers and images. The Docker CLI enables developers to interact with the Docker daemon to
perform container operations, manage images, networks, volumes, and more.

Docker CLI is the primary tool used by developers and operators to work with Docker containers. It supports features
such as building images from Dockerfiles, running containers, managing container lifecycle, inspecting container state,
and orchestrating multi-container applications with Docker Compose.

For more details, see https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/.
