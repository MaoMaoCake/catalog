## About JRuby

JRuby is an implementation of the Ruby programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). It allows Ruby
applications to leverage the JVM's high performance, real-time threading, and extensive Java libraries. JRuby can either
interpret Ruby code, compile it to Java bytecode ahead-of-time (AOT), or just-in-time (JIT) compile it during runtime.
This enables it to achieve performance comparable to Java and provides seamless interoperability with Java code.
