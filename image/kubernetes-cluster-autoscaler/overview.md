## About Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler

Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler automatically adjusts the size of your Kubernetes cluster by adding or removing nodes
based on resource demands. When pods cannot be scheduled due to insufficient resources, the Cluster Autoscaler
provisions new nodes to accommodate them. It scales down underutilized nodes while respecting pod disruption budgets,
node constraints, and availability. The Cluster Autoscaler integrates with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform and
works alongside the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler.
