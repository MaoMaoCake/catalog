## About OpenSCAP

OpenSCAP represents both a library and a command line tool which can be used to parse and evaluate each component of the
SCAP standard. The library approach allows for the swift creation of new SCAP tools rather than spending time learning
existing file structure. The command-line tool, called oscap, offers a multi-purpose tool designed to format content
into documents or scan the system based on this content. Whether you want to evaluate DISA STIGs, NIST‘s USGCB, or Red
Hat’s Security Response Team’s content, all are supported by OpenSCAP.

If your main goal is to perform configuration and vulnerability scans of a local system then oscap can be the right tool
for you. It can evaluate both XCCDF benchmarks and OVAL definitions and generate the appropriate results.
