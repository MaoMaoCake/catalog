## About PyTorch

PyTorch is an open-source machine learning framework that provides a flexible and powerful platform for building deep
learning models. It offers dynamic computational graphs, automatic differentiation, and native GPU acceleration through
CUDA. PyTorch is widely used in research and production for tasks ranging from computer vision to natural language
processing and reinforcement learning.

Key features include:

- Dynamic computational graphs for flexible model building
- Strong GPU acceleration with CUDA support
- Extensive ecosystem including TorchVision for computer vision and TorchAudio for audio processing
- TorchScript for production deployment
- Native support for distributed training
