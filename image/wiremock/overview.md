## About WireMock

WireMock is a flexible API mocking tool for service virtualization that enables developers to simulate HTTP-based APIs
for testing purposes. It allows you to stub and verify HTTP interactions, making it ideal for testing applications that
depend on external services. WireMock supports recording and playback of API interactions, request matching, response
templating, and can run as a standalone server or be embedded in tests.
